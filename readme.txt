Hi All,

I have created a simple quiz game.
Here you answer 5 questions and at the end of it you can submit your answers.

This is my first application using jQuery.
I have used progress bar and pagination for better flow and to learn more about jQuery.
You can view the application at - https://chirag0406.github.io/quizgame/

I hope you like it and can always suggest some improvement. 
New ideas are always welcomed. :)

Cheers !!
Happy Coding !!
